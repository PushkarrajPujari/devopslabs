This guide walks through the process of automating the deployment of the Spring PetClinic application using Jenkins, Ansible, and Docker on a Play with Docker (PWD) Alpine environment.

== üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup on Jenkins Host

Since Play with Docker (PWD) nodes come preinstalled with Docker, we did **not** install Docker manually.

We prepared the Alpine environment for Jenkins and Ansible with the following script:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/sh

echo "Updating package index..."
apk update

echo "Installing required packages: git, OpenJDK 17, Maven, curl, wget, unzip, bash..."
apk add git openjdk17 maven curl wget unzip bash

echo "Downloading latest stable Jenkins WAR file..."
wget http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war

echo "Installing font packages required for Jenkins UI..."
apk add --no-cache fontconfig ttf-dejavu

echo "Starting Jenkins in background with logs written to jenkins.log..."
nohup java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080 > jenkins.log 2>&1 &

echo "Jenkins is starting... Tail the log with: tail -f jenkins.log"
----

Additionally, we installed the following tools for deployment and automation:

[source,sh]
----
apk add ansible openssh python3
----

== üìÅ Ansible Configuration

An Ansible folder was created at the root of the Jenkins node:

[source,sh]
----
mkdir /root/ansible
cd /root/ansible
----

=== Inventory File: `inventory.ini`

[source,ini]
----
[remote]
remote-node ansible_host=192.168.0.13 ansible_user=root ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
----

=== Playbook: `deploy-petclinic-with-jar.yml`

[source,yaml]
----

- name: Deploy PetClinic to remote node
  hosts: remote
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create deployment directory on remote
      file:
        path: /root/petclinic-deploy/target
        state: directory

    - name: Copy built JAR to remote
      copy:
        src: /root/.jenkins/workspace/spring-app-ansible/spring-petclinic/target/spring-petclinic-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
        dest: /root/petclinic-deploy/target/spring-petclinic-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

    - name: Copy Dockerfile from project to remote
      copy:
        src: /root/.jenkins/workspace/spring-app-ansible/spring-petclinic/Dockerfile
        dest: /root/petclinic-deploy/Dockerfile

    - name: Build Docker image on remote
      shell: |
        cd /root/petclinic-deploy
        docker build -t petclinic-app .

    - name: Run Docker container on remote
      shell: |
        docker rm -f petclinic || true
        docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name petclinic petclinic-app
----

== ü§ñ Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline is configured to:
1. Clone the Spring PetClinic repo
2. Build the JAR with Maven
3. Deploy to a remote Docker host via Ansible

=== Jenkinsfile

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        PROJECT_DIR = "spring-petclinic"
        JAR_PATH = "${PROJECT_DIR}/target/spring-petclinic-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
        REMOTE_DEPLOY_DIR = "/root/petclinic-deploy"
        ANSIBLE_DIR = "/root/ansible"
        INVENTORY_FILE = "${ANSIBLE_DIR}/inventory.ini"
        PLAYBOOK_FILE = "${ANSIBLE_DIR}/deploy-petclinic-with-jar.yml"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                dir(PROJECT_DIR) {
                    git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/PushkarrajPujari/spring-petclinic.git'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build JAR with Maven') {
            steps {
                dir(PROJECT_DIR) {
                   sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests"
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Remote via Ansible') {
            steps {
                sh "ansible-playbook -i ${INVENTORY_FILE} ${PLAYBOOK_FILE}"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== ‚úÖ Output

Once deployed, the PetClinic app will be available at the remote host's IP on port `8080`.

Example: http://192.168.0.13:8080

== üßπ Cleanup (Optional)

To stop and remove the container:

[source,sh]
----
docker rm -f petclinic
----

== üìå Notes

- Docker comes pre-installed in PWD Alpine nodes.
- SSH access between nodes is handled using Ansible's configuration to skip host key checks.
- Jenkins was launched using the WAR file without any additional service manager.

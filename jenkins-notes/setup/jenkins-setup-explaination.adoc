== Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to manually set up Jenkins on _Play with Docker_ using an Alpine Linux environment. It installs necessary packages, fetches the Jenkins WAR file, resolves font issues, and runs Jenkins in the background with logging.

== Prerequisites

- A Play with Docker session: https://labs.play-with-docker.com
- A running Alpine Linux container

== Steps

=== 1. Update Package Index

Run the following command to update the Alpine package repository:

[source,sh]
----
apk update
----

=== 2. Install Required Packages

Install Java 17, Git, Maven, and other essential tools:

[source,sh]
----
apk add git openjdk17 maven curl wget unzip bash
----

=== 3. Download Jenkins WAR File

Download the latest stable Jenkins WAR file:

[source,sh]
----
wget http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
----

=== 4. Fix Missing Fonts Issue

Jenkins requires some fonts to render the UI properly. Install them using:

[source,sh]
----
apk add --no-cache fontconfig ttf-dejavu
----

=== 5. Start Jenkins in Background with Logging

Start Jenkins on port 8080 using `nohup` and redirect all logs to `jenkins.log`:

[source,sh]
----
nohup java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080 > jenkins.log 2>&1 &
----

You can tail the logs using:

[source,sh]
----
tail -f jenkins.log
----

== Access Jenkins

Once Jenkins is running, access it through your browser using:

```
http://<your-play-with-docker-instance-ip>:8080
```


Check the terminal logs or the log file for the initial admin password:

[source,sh]
----
cat /root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
----

== Conclusion

You now have Jenkins running in a minimal Alpine-based container using Play with Docker, with logs saved to a file. You can proceed with installing plugins, setting up jobs, and configuring builds.

== Basic Level

=== 1. What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and multi-node orchestration. It is agentless and uses SSH for communication.

=== 2. What are the key features of Ansible?

* Agentless architecture
* Simple, YAML-based playbooks
* Idempotent operations
* Uses SSH for connectivity
* Extensible with custom modules

=== 3. What is an Ansible playbook?

A playbook is a YAML file containing a list of tasks to be executed on managed nodes. It defines what needs to be done on which hosts.

=== 4. What is the difference between a playbook and an ad-hoc command?

* Ad-hoc commands are used for quick, one-time tasks.
* Playbooks are used for repeatable and consistent automation.

=== 5. What is an inventory file?

An inventory file is used to define the list of hosts or groups of hosts on which Ansible will operate. It can be a static file or dynamically generated.

== Intermediate Level

=== 6. What are Ansible modules?

Modules are small programs used by Ansible to perform specific tasks such as installing packages, copying files, or restarting services. Examples: `yum`, `apt`, `copy`, `service`, `ping`.

=== 7. What is a role in Ansible?

Roles are a way to organize playbooks and related files into a structured format. They contain folders like `tasks`, `handlers`, `templates`, `vars`, and `files`.

=== 8. How do you run an Ansible playbook?

Use the following command:
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
----

=== 9. What is Ansible Galaxy?

Ansible Galaxy is a community hub where users can find, share, and reuse Ansible roles and collections.

=== 10. How does Ansible ensure idempotency?

Ansible modules are designed to be idempotent, meaning running the same playbook multiple times will not change the system after the first run unless necessary.

== Advanced Level

=== 11. How do you handle secrets in Ansible?

Ansible provides a feature called *Vault* to encrypt secrets like passwords or keys. Use the command:
----
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
----

=== 12. How can you test Ansible roles?

You can use tools like *Molecule* to test Ansible roles in different environments.

=== 13. What is the purpose of the `become` directive?

`become: yes` allows privilege escalation (e.g., sudo) to run tasks as a different user, typically root.

=== 14. How can you execute a task only when a condition is met?

Use the `when` clause:
----
- name: Install Apache only on CentOS
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: present
  when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
----

=== 15. What is the difference between `copy` and `template` modules?

* `copy` simply copies a file.
* `template` processes a Jinja2 template before copying, allowing dynamic content.

== Conclusion

These questions cover fundamental to advanced concepts in Ansible. Preparing these will help you in interviews and in practical Ansible usage.

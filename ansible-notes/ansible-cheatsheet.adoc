== üî∞ What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for:
- Configuration management
- Application deployment
- Task automation

It uses **YAML** to define automation tasks (called *playbooks*) and works over **SSH**‚Äîno agent required.

== üß∞ Basic Terminology

|===
| Term      | Meaning

| Inventory | A list of managed hosts
| Module    | The units of work executed by Ansible
| Ad-hoc    | One-line command for quick tasks
| Playbook  | A YAML file describing a set of tasks
| Role      | A structured way of organizing playbooks
| Facts     | Information collected about a system
|===

== üìÇ Inventory File Example

[source,ini]
----
[web]
192.168.0.21 ansible_user=root

[db]
192.168.0.22 ansible_user=root
----

== ‚ö° Ad-Hoc Commands

=== Ping all hosts

[source,bash]
----
ansible all -i hosts -m ping
----

‚û°Ô∏è Uses the `ping` module to test SSH connectivity.

=== Run shell command

[source,bash]
----
ansible all -i hosts -m shell -a "uptime"
----

‚û°Ô∏è Runs a shell command on all inventory hosts.

=== Create a file

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -i hosts -m file -a "path=/tmp/test.txt state=touch"
----

‚û°Ô∏è Creates a new file on all `web` hosts.

=== Install a package (if supported by system)

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -i hosts -m package -a "name=tree state=present"
----

‚û°Ô∏è Installs the `tree` package if available.

== üìú Playbook Structure

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: web
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure nginx is installed
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
----

|===
| Module       | Description                           

| `ping`       | Test connectivity                     
| `copy`       | Copy a file to remote host            
| `file`       | Create/delete files or directories    
| `package`    | Install or remove software packages   
| `service`    | Manage system services                
| `user`       | Manage user accounts                  
| `debug`      | Print variables/debug messages        
| `setup`      | Gather facts about the system

|===
| Option            | Purpose                             

| `-i hosts`        | Specify inventory file              
| `-m <module>`     | Use a specific module               
| `-a <args>`       | Pass arguments to module            
| `--check`         | Dry-run mode                        
| `-v / -vvv`       | Verbose output                      
|===

== üìÅ Example: Docker + Nginx Playbook

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Run Nginx in Docker
  hosts: web
  become: true
  collections:
    - community.docker

  tasks:
    - name: Pull Nginx image
      community.docker.docker_image:
        name: nginx
        source: pull

    - name: Start Nginx container
      community.docker.docker_container:
        name: nginx-server
        image: nginx
        state: started
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
----

== üéØ Tips

- Use `ansible-doc <module>` to get help on any module
- Always test with `--check` before applying real changes
- Use `tags` in playbooks to selectively run tasks
- Use `handlers` for restarting services only when needed

== 🎯 Objective

This lab introduces the basics of Ansible automation. By the end of this practical, MCA students will be able to:

- Understand how Ansible works
- Run ad-hoc commands
- Create and execute simple playbooks
- Manage inventory files and use core modules like `ping`, `copy`, `file`, and `package`

== 🧩 Lab Setup

You will need:

- 1 Ansible controller node (e.g., `node1`)
- 1 or more managed nodes (e.g., `node2`, `node3`)
- All systems should be Linux (Alpine/Ubuntu/CentOS)

TIP: Use https://labs.play-with-docker.com to spin up 2–3 Alpine instances. SSH access is preconfigured.

== 🔧 Step 1: Install Ansible on the Controller Node

[source,bash]
----
apk update
apk add --no-cache ansible openssh
----

== 📁 Step 2: Create Inventory File

[source,bash]
----
echo "[web]" > hosts
echo "192.168.0.21 ansible_user=root" >> hosts
echo "192.168.0.22 ansible_user=root" >> hosts
----

Replace the IPs with your managed node IPs.

== ⚡ Lab 1: Ad-Hoc Commands

=== 🔹 1.1 Test Connection Using Ping Module

[source,bash]
----
ansible -i hosts web -m ping
----

=== 🔹 1.2 Check Uptime

[source,bash]
----
ansible -i hosts web -m shell -a "uptime"
----

=== 🔹 1.3 Check Disk Usage

[source,bash]
----
ansible -i hosts web -m shell -a "df -h"
----

=== 🔹 1.4 Create a File Remotely

[source,bash]
----
ansible -i hosts web -m file -a "path=/tmp/mca.txt state=touch"
----

=== 🔹 1.5 Install Package (Optional)

(Use only if the system supports `apt` or `yum`)

[source,bash]
----
ansible -i hosts web -m package -a "name=tree state=present"
----

== 📜 Lab 2: Writing and Running a Playbook

=== 🔹 2.1 Create the Playbook File

Create a file named `mca_demo.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: MCA Ansible Playbook Demo
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Create a welcome file
      copy:
        content: "Welcome MCA Students to Ansible Lab!\n"
        dest: /tmp/welcome.txt

    - name: Ensure a directory exists
      file:
        path: /opt/mca-lab
        state: directory

    - name: Install tree (optional)
      package:
        name: tree
        state: present
----

=== 🔹 2.2 Run the Playbook

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts mca_demo.yml
----

=== 🔹 2.3 Verify the Changes

Log in to any managed node and run:

[source,bash]
----
cat /tmp/welcome.txt
ls -l /opt/mca-lab
tree /opt
----

== 🧠 Viva / Review Questions

1. What is the role of the inventory file in Ansible?
2. What is an ad-hoc command? Give one example.
3. How is a playbook different from an ad-hoc command?
4. Name three commonly used Ansible modules.
5. How can you ensure a directory exists on a remote system using Ansible?

== ✅ Expected Outcomes

After completing this lab, students will:

- Understand how Ansible communicates over SSH
- Use ad-hoc commands to perform basic automation
- Create and run a simple playbook with common modules
- Be confident using Ansible for small automation tasks

== 📎 Additional Tips

- Use `--check` with playbooks to run in dry-run mode
- Use `-v` or `-vvv` for more verbose output
- Learn more modules at https://docs.ansible.com/

🎉 Congratulations on completing your first Ansible lab!

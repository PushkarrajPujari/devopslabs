== 🧪 Ansible Command Breakdown & Explanations

This section explains common Ansible CLI commands used in MCA practicals.

=== 📌 1. Basic Ping Test

[source,bash]
----
ansible all -i hosts -m ping
----

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Part              | Meaning
| `ansible`         | The Ansible command-line tool
| `all`             | Target all hosts from the inventory
| `-i hosts`        | Use the inventory file named `hosts`
| `-m ping`         | Use the `ping` module to check connectivity (via SSH)
|===

📝 The `ping` module doesn't use ICMP — it checks SSH + Python availability.

---

=== 📌 2. Run a Shell Command

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -i hosts -m shell -a "uptime"
----

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Part              | Meaning
| `web`             | Target only the `web` group from the inventory
| `-m shell`        | Use the `shell` module to run Linux shell commands
| `-a "uptime"`     | Arguments to the shell module — runs the `uptime` command
|===

📝 You can replace `"uptime"` with any shell command like `df -h`, `ls -l`, etc.

---

=== 📌 3. Create a File on Remote Hosts

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -i hosts -m file -a "path=/tmp/test.txt state=touch"
----

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| `-m file`         | Use the `file` module
| `path=...`        | The path where the file should be created
| `state=touch`     | Creates an empty file (like `touch` command)
|===

📝 Other `state` values: `absent` (delete), `directory` (make folder)

---

=== 📌 4. Install a Package (e.g., `tree`)

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -i hosts -m package -a "name=tree state=present"
----

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| `-m package`      | Use the `package` module (works on many OS types)
| `name=tree`       | Package to install
| `state=present`   | Ensures the package is installed
|===

📝 If you're on Alpine Linux, `tree` can also be installed using `apk add tree`.

---

=== 📌 5. Run a Playbook

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx_docker.yml
----

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| `ansible-playbook` | Command to run a YAML-based playbook
| `-i hosts`         | Inventory file to use
| `nginx_docker.yml`| Name of the playbook file to run
|===

📝 Playbooks are used for complex and repeatable automation — much better than ad-hoc commands for real-world use.

---

=== 📌 6. Check Available Modules

[source,bash]
----
ansible-doc -l
----

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
| `ansible-doc`     | Shows documentation for Ansible modules
| `-l`              | Lists all available modules
|===

To view details of a specific module:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-doc file
----

📝 Use this to learn module options without Googling everything.

---

=== 📝 Summary Table of Flags

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Flag        | Description
| `-i`        | Specify the inventory file
| `-m`        | Specify the module to run
| `-a`        | Provide arguments to the module
| `--check`   | Dry-run mode (show what would change)
| `-v`/`-vvv` | Increase verbosity for debugging
|===

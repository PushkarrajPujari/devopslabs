== üéØ Objective

Use Ansible to automate the deployment of an Nginx container using Docker on a remote node inside the Play with Docker (PWD) platform.

== üß± Setup Environment on Play with Docker

1. Go to https://labs.play-with-docker.com
2. Click "Start" and add **two Alpine instances**:
   - `node1`: Ansible Controller
   - `node2`: Managed Node (Docker host)
3. Copy the IP address of `node2` ‚Äî you will use it in the inventory file.

== ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Install Ansible on Controller Node (node1)

[source,bash]
----
apk update
apk add --no-cache ansible py3-pip
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install docker
ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker
----

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `apk update`              | Update Alpine package index
| `apk add ansible`         | Install Ansible
| `pip install docker`      | Install Python Docker SDK (required for Docker modules)
| `ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker` | Install official Docker modules
|===

== üóÇÔ∏è Step 2: Create Inventory File

[source,bash]
----
echo "[web]" > hosts
echo "192.168.0.21 ansible_user=root" >> hosts
----

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `[web]`                  | Group of target machines
| `192.168.0.21`           | IP address of node2 (replace with your actual IP)
| `ansible_user=root`      | Ansible will SSH as the root user
|===

== üìú Step 3: Create Ansible Playbook

Create a file named `nginx_docker.yml`.

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Run Nginx on Docker using Ansible (PWD)
  hosts: web
  become: true
  collections:
    - community.docker

  tasks:
    - name: Pull Nginx image
      community.docker.docker_image:
        name: nginx
        source: pull

    - name: Run Nginx container
      community.docker.docker_container:
        name: nginx-server
        image: nginx
        state: started
        ports:
          - "8080:80"
----

=== üîç Explanation

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `hosts: web`                    | Targets all hosts in the `[web]` group
| `become: true`                  | Uses sudo for root privileges
| `docker_image` module           | Pulls the nginx image if not present
| `docker_container` module       | Starts a container from the nginx image
| `"8080:80"`                     | Maps port 8080 on the host to 80 inside the container
|===

== ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 4: Run the Playbook

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx_docker.yml
----

=== üîç Command Breakdown

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| `ansible-playbook`         | Command to run a YAML-based playbook
| `-i hosts`                 | Specifies the inventory file to use
| `nginx_docker.yml`         | Playbook file to execute
|===

== ‚úÖ Step 5: Test the Setup

Open a browser and visit:

[source,text]
----
http://<node2-ip>:8080
----

You should see the default **Nginx Welcome Page**.

== üß™ Bonus: Check Running Containers on Node2

SSH into node2 and run:

[source,bash]
----
docker ps
----

You‚Äôll see a running container named `nginx-server`.

== üìù Summary

- You used **Ansible** to automate the Docker workflow.
- Nginx is running inside a **Docker container** on a managed host.
- All steps were tested on **Play with Docker (PWD)** using Alpine instances.

== Objective

Learn how to use Ansible to deploy an Nginx container on a managed node using the `ansible.builtin.command` module. This approach avoids Python Docker SDK dependencies and works well in minimal environments like Play with Docker.

== Lab Environment

- Platform: Play with Docker (https://labs.play-with-docker.com)
- Nodes:
  - node1: Ansible Controller
  - node2: Managed Host

== Step 1: Set Up the Inventory File

On `node1`, create a file called `hosts` with the following content:

[source,ini]
----
[web]
192.168.0.12 ansible_user=root
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace `192.168.0.12` with your actual `node2` IP address shown in the PWD terminal.
====

== Step 2: Create the Ansible Playbook

On `node1`, create a file called `nginx_docker.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Run Nginx via Docker using shell command
  hosts: web
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Pull Nginx image
      ansible.builtin.command: docker pull nginx

    - name: Run Nginx container
      ansible.builtin.command: docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-server nginx
----

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Line | Description

| `- name: Run Nginx...` | Describes the playbook's purpose.
| `hosts: web` | Targets the `web` group defined in the inventory.
| `become: true` | Elevates privilege to `root` to run Docker commands.
| `ansible.builtin.command` | Ansible module to run shell commands directly on the managed node.
| `docker pull nginx` | Downloads the official Nginx image from Docker Hub to the managed node.
| `docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-server nginx` | Launches an Nginx container in detached mode, maps container port 80 to host port 8080, and names it `nginx-server`.
|===

== Step 3: Run the Playbook

From `node1`, execute:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx_docker.yml
----

This command tells Ansible to use the `hosts` file and execute the tasks in the `nginx_docker.yml` playbook.

== Step 4: Verify the Deployment

Open your browser and navigate to:

[source,text]
----
http://<node2-public-ip>:8080
----

You should see the default Nginx welcome page. Replace `<node2-public-ip>` with your actual IP.

== Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

To stop and remove the container from `node2`:

[source,bash]
----
docker rm -f nginx-server
----

== Summary of Key Commands and Their Meanings

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Command | Explanation

| `ansible-playbook` | CLI tool to run Ansible playbooks.
| `-i hosts` | Specifies the inventory file to use.
| `become: true` | Ensures tasks are run with elevated privileges.
| `ansible.builtin.command` | Runs shell-level commands on the target host.
| `docker pull nginx` | Pulls the latest Nginx image to the target system.
| `docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-server nginx` | Runs Nginx container in detached mode, maps ports, and assigns a name.
| `docker rm -f nginx-server` | Forcefully stops and deletes the container.
|===

== Troubleshooting Tips

- If Docker commands fail, ensure Docker is installed and running on `node2`.
- If playbook fails to connect, check the IP and SSH access.
- If Nginx doesn't appear in the browser, verify the port mapping and firewall settings.

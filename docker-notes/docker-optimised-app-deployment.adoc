== 🎯 Objective

This lab guides you to:
- Configure an Alpine Linux environment on Play with Docker (PWD)
- Install Java 17, Maven, Git
- Clone and build the Spring PetClinic app
- Create a Dockerfile
- Build and run the app in a Docker container

== 🧪 Environment

- Platform: https://labs.play-with-docker.com
- Alpine Linux instance (from PWD)
- Internet access inside container (provided by PWD)
- Docker is pre-installed in the PWD instance

== 🐧 Step 1: Launch Alpine on Play with Docker

. Visit https://labs.play-with-docker.com
. Start a session, then click `+ ADD NEW INSTANCE`
. Choose *Alpine* as your image
. Open the Alpine terminal

== 🔧 Step 2: Install Required Tools

[source,bash]
----
apk update
apk add git openjdk17 maven curl wget unzip bash
----

=== Explanation

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Command | Description
| apk update | Updates the Alpine package list
| apk add ... | Installs Git, Java 17, Maven, Curl, etc.
|===

== ✅ Step 3: Verify Installations

[source,bash]
----
java -version
mvn -version
git --version
----

== 🧬 Step 4: Clone the Spring PetClinic Repo

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
----

== ⚙️ Step 5: Build the Application

Use Maven to compile the source and package it:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package -DskipTests
----

=== Explanation

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Command | Description
| mvn clean | Clears previously compiled files
| mvn package -DskipTests | Builds a JAR file, skipping unit tests
|===

== 📂 Step 6: Verify the JAR File

[source,bash]
----
ls target/
----

You should see a file like:

[source]
----
spring-petclinic-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== 📦 Step 7: Create a Dockerfile

Still inside the `spring-petclinic` directory, create a new file called `Dockerfile`:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:17
COPY target/spring-petclinic-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
----

=== Dockerfile Explained

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Line | Description
| FROM openjdk:17 | Base image with Java 17 runtime
| COPY target/... app.jar | Copies the built JAR into the container
| EXPOSE 8080 | Exposes port 8080 for external access
| CMD [...] | Starts the application using Java
|===

== 🏗️ Step 8: Build the Docker Image

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t petclinic-app .
----

=== Explanation

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Option | Description
| -t petclinic-app | Tags the image as "petclinic-app"
| . | Specifies current directory as build context (must contain Dockerfile)
|===

== 🚀 Step 9: Run the PetClinic Container

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name petclinic petclinic-app
----

=== Explanation

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Option | Description
| -d | Detached mode (runs in background)
| -p 8080:8080 | Maps host port 8080 to container port 8080
| --name petclinic | Assigns a name to the container
| petclinic-app | Name of the Docker image to run
|===

== 🔍 Step 10: Test It

In your browser, open:

[source]
----
http://<node-public-ip>:8080
----

Use the public IP provided by Play with Docker for your Alpine node.

== 🧼 Cleanup (Optional)

[source,bash]
----
docker rm -f petclinic
----

== 📌 Summary

You have successfully:
- Set up Alpine with Java, Maven, Git
- Cloned and built the Spring PetClinic app
- Packaged it using a Dockerfile
- Deployed and verified the app via Docker

== 🚀 Bonus: Automate This with Ansible?

Check out the follow-up lab to automate this using Ansible to:
- Build the app on one node
- Transfer to a second node
- Deploy with Docker remotely
